#### Created by David Parker, last modified by Theodore Gauthier on Apr 06, 2021
To help you better understand some of the common terms used, we’ve collected some quick terminology and corresponding definitions for you based on the most commonly used terms in the Ecosystem.

<!-- 
| TERM        | DEFINATION          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Distribute           | this is defined as any product that is for external consumption (not limited to Customers, VARS, Distributors, Field Services, Demo Depot, Capital Leasing, Partners, Labs) |
| Organization | Any development team within Cisco that distributes software externally  | 
|TPSCRM	|Third Party Software Compliance and Risk Management|
|TPS	| Third Party Software (Open Source or Commercial) |
|TPSD	 |Third Party Software Digitization (this refers to the entire platform and services, or ecosystem) |
|TPSCRM |	Third Party Software Compliance and Risk Management (this refers to the entire platform and services, or ecosystem) |

|Security Insights (SI) |	This tool provides visibility into CSDL compliance information for projects, solutions, and hosted services in development at Cisco |
|Corona (TPS discovery, including binary scanning)	| Internal software decomposition and analytics solution harness that integrates with other Cisco development tools and processes to enable the delivery of trustworthy software to our customers by providing enhanced visibility into our products to better understand exposures to security vulnerabilities and asset accounting prior to shipping |
| Black Duck |	Risk management tool designed to help you manage the logistics of using open source software in your organization |
| TPS Compliance |	Third Party Software (Compliance) Product, Release and Image details related to the compliance requirement actions that must be fulfilled to ensure that a given Product goes from RED to GREEN state |
| CIAM	| The Cisco Internal Alert Manager (CIAM) is a Cisco-internal tool that alerts engineers about vulnerabilities in their third-party software components|

| BE	| (Cisco) Business Entity |
|BU	 | (Cisco) Business Unit |
|UI	 | User Interface |
| Product	| The main service or offering your team is creating | 
| Release	| Each version of your Product |
| Image	| A group of Components derived from scanning a binary file that you plan to deliver to a customer mostly automatically discovered via scanning, but can contain manually added Components |

| RM | 	Reusable Module – an Image or Component group shared with other teams to share responsibility for license and vulnerability alerts |
| BYOS / TPS Manifest BOM	| Bring Your Own Scan. Officially referred to as TPS Manifest BOM. Many cloud and source-only projects don't have a binary file that Corona can scan, so you can provide a list of discovered components using source scanning tools and provide those to Corona |
| Software BOM	| BOM or Bill of Materials in manufacturing are the components that make up the product. Cisco based software projects also are required to have a Software Bill of Materials. Corona helps you determine what's in your project | 
|Triage |	Making manual updates to your Software BOM to make sure it is as accurate as possible |
|Markup	| Information manually added to your Software BOM. This could be version overrides, manually added Components or more |
| Version-less	| Components where the scanning tools did not find a version for the Component |

| RTD |	Run Time Defense – methods and technologies which assist in hardening of software components |
| SaaS |	Software as a Service |
| SAR |	Security Awareness Report |
| SHA |	Secure Hash Algorithm – A method of computing a hash. Variants include SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512. Each version is harder to decrypt providing a higher level of security. SHA-1 is commonly used to uniquely identify a file or Component |
| TRM	 | Scanning tool for classic IOS (Cisco OS for legacy routers, switches, etc.) focused on run time defense posturing |
| Alias |	 The name of a supplier or component |
| Atomic Alias | At the level of Supplier or Component; it is a way of setting a master name and associating sets of aliases together |
| Tuple Alias | Tuple aliases combine scope, supplier, component, version, and release. Scope, supplier, component and version are required, release is optional |
| Supplier | An entity (person, group, organization, corporation, etc.) who publishes a software component |
|BOM |	Bill of Materials (list of components in an image or release) |
| Component | An entire software package that is available for purchase or download separately from other components |
| Version | A label assigned to a component indicating it's place in the lineage of other published components and/or specific features |
| Release | A secondary label with similar properties of 'Version' used to further describe a components unique position its lineage |
| Context | A group of alias names that are in use by a single system or by a coordinated group of systems |
| Scopes | Independently searchable namespaces of composite records that have at minimum supplier, component and version fields populated |
| Merging and Splitting | Essentially the acts of combining atomic alias names together or splitting them apart |
| Master Name/Master Alias | For a given set of atomic aliases, one is identified as a “Master Name”, this is a chosen preferred name and can be changed at any given time through administration |
